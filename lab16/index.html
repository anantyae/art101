			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs </h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we had to use AJAX to put a an api in to create a 
						functioning button that pulled information from the api.</p>
					
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My problem was I tried for hours on another site and asked for help but apparently that site might not have 
						used the right api so I had to do a different one.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab wasn;t hard once I used the properly functioning api.   </p>
