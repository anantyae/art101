			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon and Callbacks </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge was to make an anonymous function that we can callback. We used arrays to show whoch numbers were odd 
                        and what they are multiplied by 2.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> We had a hard time doing the bonus task. We could no think of a way to show our output.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> We figured out how to do the main task without much struggle. </p> 
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p> As you can see looking at our js in console, it came out how it should have. </p>
