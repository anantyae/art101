                <p>My name is Anantya and I'm a first year art major with no programming experience. 
                    I focus on sculpture and I tought myself how to weld. I rock climb almost every day
                     and I have since I was very young. I'm pretty clueless with computers but I'd love 
                     to learn more and I feel like it could help me improve my art. I want to double major 
                     but I don;t know what I want to do yet so that kind of stresses me out. My partner's 
                     name is Leeza and she has basic HTML experience. She is AGPM major and is self described "major nerd".</p>
