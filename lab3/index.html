			<h1>Lab 3 - File Stucture and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challege was to connect the files to our html homepage so we could link all 
						the labs. From there we needed to add a picture of the code from the refection
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first I wasn;t able to figure out how to insert images in a different folder but 
						I was able to go back to today's lesson and find the "../" method in going back to 
						another folder.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I seemed to have gotten the webpage and my homepage up and running which I would say is a 
						sucess so I think I did a good job and put in a good amount of effort to figure it out with
						little html knowlege I learned in this class. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The webpage and the homepage are both surpisingly up.</p>
