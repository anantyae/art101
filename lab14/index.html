			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we were suppose to debug a pervious lab but because I didn't have any labs that didn't work, I needed to do task x which was answering questions from other people.</p>
					
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My problem is that people on the website seemed to have much more programming experience than me so I found one question 
                        that I was able to research the answer to.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab not too bad because I didn't have any pervious labs to debug  </p>
